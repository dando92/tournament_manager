/**
 * Checks the dataset against the rules the application would have applied.
 *
 * The generator decides a match's state first and then writes evidence that
 * produces it, which is the only way to build one in bulk: `MatchAggregate`
 * lives in the API and a tool cannot import it. That makes the states correct
 * by construction and wrong the moment the construction has a bug, so the
 * construction is checked here, from the rows alone.
 *
 * The active-match check is scoped to a tournament, which is the rule the
 * application actually enforces: `ACTIVE_CONFLICTS` in `ScheduleRunner` asks
 * whether a player is on a cabinet inside this tournament. Somebody entered in
 * two tournaments running at once is a scheduling problem for a venue, not a
 * contradiction in the data.
 *
 * `ready` against `tiebreak_required` cannot be checked in full: telling those
 * apart is placement resolution rather than a query, because it depends on
 * whether the outgoing rules would send tied players to different
 * destinations. Both halves of the premise can be checked, though — a match
 * waiting on a tiebreak must actually be tied and must have somewhere to send
 * the tied players, and a `ready` match must not be tied at all — and that is
 * what caught a scoring system awarding a point to one of two equal
 * percentages.
