# Migration Execution Status

## Current Position

- Last updated: 2026-08-19.
- Completed plan: [Simplified Architecture Migration Plan](MigrationPlan.md).
- State: Migration complete.
- Current runtime: API, migrations, local fixtures, SyncStart, Realtime, frontend, PostgreSQL, and Redis run without processor or durable-event infrastructure.
- Next action: none; future work follows the normal product backlog and the deferred questions in [FunctionalQuestions.md](FunctionalQuestions.md).

## Completed Checkpoints

### Object-oriented ownership design rule

- Recorded the SyncStart ownership model as the default for new backend development: stateful concepts own their state and transitions, while coordinators own composition and lifecycle coordination.
- Existing components are evaluated for incremental adoption when touched; the rule does not mandate unrelated rewrites or class wrappers around stateless pure functions.

### Backend internal HTTP client standard

- Recorded the approved standard for backend-to-backend HTTP: NestJS `HttpModule`, injected `HttpService`, and `firstValueFrom`; direct global `fetch` calls are not used by application-owned HTTP adapters.

### SyncStart outbound HTTP adapter

- Replaced the direct global `fetch` call in `CompletedSongSubmitter` with injected NestJS `HttpService`; the application module imports `HttpModule` for runtime wiring and the existing unit test now mocks the injectable client.
- Verification passed: `npm run lint --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart`, `npm run test --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart -- --runInBand` (5 suites, 16 tests), and `npm run build --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart`.

### SyncStart application unit-test coverage

- Added isolated unit tests for `TournamentSyncStartRegistry`, `InternalController` delegation, `SyncStartEventsPublisher`, `CompletedSongSubmitter`, and lifecycle cleanup in `LobbyCatalog`; no Nest module test or production-code change was required.
- Verification passed: `npm run lint --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart` and `npm run test --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart -- --runInBand` (5 suites, 16 tests).

### SyncStart refactoring completion

- Extracted `LobbyStateInterpreter` and `LobbySession` from `SyncStartClient`; normalized state transitions and completion de-duplication are now unit-testable without a WebSocket.
- Added injectable WebSocket and SyncStart-client factories, clean protocol/application/simulator builds, and an architecture guard for simulator isolation.
- Verification passed: `npm run lint --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart-protocol`, `npm run build --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart-protocol`, `npm run lint --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart`, `npm run test --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart-protocol -- --runInBand`, `npm run test --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart -- --runInBand`, and `npm run check:architecture`.

### SyncStart protocol package and session ownership refinement

- Created `@tournament-manager/syncstart-protocol` and moved the external SyncStart WebSocket connector, transport primitives, protocol types, and deterministic simulator from the SyncStart application into it.
- Replaced the command-switching `SyncStartSessionManager` with `TournamentSyncStartRegistry`, which owns one protocol client per configured tournament and exposes the direct operations used by the internal controller.
- Extracted `LobbyCatalog` as the volatile projection of observed lobby metadata. It is updated through protocol events and merges local metadata with remote lobby-search results without owning connections.
- Updated the SyncStart image build order, workspace metadata, architecture documentation, and protocol unit-test ownership.
- Verification passed: `npm run build --workspace=@tournament-manager/contracts`, `npm run build --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart-protocol`, `npm run build --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart`, `npm run test --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart-protocol`, and `npm run lint --workspace=@tournament-manager/syncstart`.

### Scoring package boundary cleanup

- Renamed the generic `@tournament-manager/application` workspace to `@tournament-manager/scoring` and split its former barrel implementation into focused scoring interfaces, calculators, identifier types, and provider files.
- Made `ScoringSystemType` and `SCORING_SYSTEM_TYPES` the canonical scoring identifiers. Persistence entity fields and API DTOs now use the type, while request validation and OpenAPI metadata use the runtime identifier list.
- Kept bracket implementations and `BracketSystemProvider` inside the API because they directly orchestrate API services and persistence. The currently selected bracket type remains persisted on each phase group and is consumed by API and frontend behavior.
- Updated workspace dependency rules, Docker builds, and architecture documentation for the new package boundary.
- Verification passed: `npm run build`, `npm run lint` (existing warnings only), `npm test --workspace=@tournament-manager/api -- --runInBand` (8 suites, 26 tests), `npm run check:architecture`, and a clean build of `apps/migrations/Dockerfile`.

### Phase 0 complete

- Replaced the superseded target architecture, backend rules, migration plan, and functional-question framing with the approved simplified architecture and explicit reliability tradeoffs.
- Rebased the behavior inventory on the current extracted API, SyncStart, Realtime, processor, and Redis transport runtime; it identifies the existing protocol, completed-song, realtime-routing, match/advancement, standings, and Start.gg coverage that protects later phases.
- Updated the repository overview to distinguish transitional processor/eventing workspaces from target migration, local-fixtures, live-messaging, and Start.gg workspaces.
- No additional characterization test was required: focused unit, protocol, realtime, and PostgreSQL/Redis e2e suites already cover the behavior later simplifications will move.

### Phase 1 complete

- Created the independent `apps/migrations` workspace, Docker image, runner, scripts, and migration-runner e2e test. API test helpers now use the extracted migration source.
- Created `apps/local-fixtures` as a one-shot Nest application. It creates the deterministic tournament idempotently, supports an optional `LOCAL_FIXTURE_SYNCSTART_URL`, and is run only by local Compose after migrations and SyncStart are ready.
- Made the bundled SyncStart simulator optional through the `simulator` Compose profile; a fixture can instead use a configured host or remote WebSocket URL.
- Created `@tournament-manager/startgg` and moved its GraphQL client, operations, provider types, parsing, pagination, rate limiting, and response mapping out of the API. API orchestration and HTTP DTOs remain in place.
- Removed `AppLogger` and `PostgresTournamentPersistence`; `TournamentService` now owns its creation transaction directly.
- Added the migrations image to continuous delivery and updated workspace, Docker, runtime configuration, architecture checks, and local-operation documentation.

### Phases 2 through 5 review

- API-to-SyncStart commands and SyncStart-to-API completed songs use authenticated internal HTTP.
- Redis Pub/Sub carries replaceable live messages through `@tournament-manager/live-messaging`; processor, Streams, outbox, inbox, retries, dead letters, and retention code were removed.
- Deployment topology, CI matrix, local checks, and service images no longer include the processor.
- Final code parity verification passed for API unit tests, contract tests, PostgreSQL/Redis e2e tests, workspace builds, and architecture boundaries. Existing lint warnings remain non-blocking.

### Migration closure complete

- Fixed missing workspace build dependencies in the API and local-fixtures images and enabled Nest dependency-injection metadata in `@tournament-manager/live-messaging`.
- Made repository and local verification build shared workspaces before running tests, and aligned the affected e2e tests with the synchronous SyncStart and lazy Redis publisher lifecycles.
- Consolidated the pre-production database history into one application-only baseline; eventing migrations, tables, indexes, and the obsolete `transportPurgedAt` field were removed.
- Removed stale processor, Streams, outbox, inbox, retry, dead-letter, and retention procedures from local operations documentation.
- Passed clean-stack verification and a second complete verification after restarting with PostgreSQL and Redis volumes retained.

### Live messaging boundary refinement

- Moved generic event envelopes and their validation from `@tournament-manager/contracts` into `@tournament-manager/live-messaging`. Contracts now contain only SyncStart DTOs and internal HTTP request contracts.
- Defined `EventEnvelope`, `IdentifiedEventEnvelope`, and `SequencedLiveEventEnvelope` around the shared tournament scope; completed-song processing uses the identified variant for idempotency.
- Organized Redis adapters under `transports/redis` and added `InMemoryLiveEventTransport`, which implements both publisher and subscriber ports for Redis-free tests.
- Updated application imports, package dependencies, architecture documentation, and envelope/in-memory transport tests.
- Verification passed: builds and type lint for contracts, live-messaging, API, SyncStart, and Realtime; `npm run test:contract`; and `npm run test:unit` (all workspace unit suites passed). API lint completed with its nine pre-existing warnings and no errors.
